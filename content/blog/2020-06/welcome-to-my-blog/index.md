Hey, I'm Fangzheng. I'm a master student study computer engineering in Germany. 

I enjoy engineering products that can have a good business impact and simplify our daily lives. I believe that the only valuable skill that I possess is the skill to learn and acquire new skills by being intrinsically curious and driven.


This is the first blog post using GatsbyJS. I will share my thoughts, life and study here. 

```python
print('Hello,World!')
```


```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!')
```
